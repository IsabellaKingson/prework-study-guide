# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a project I created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework to study the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. I used it as a guide to learn the basics of these concepts and as a reference point for future work. It allows me to keep my notes on these topics in one place and to practice coding in different languages and contributing using the Git workflow.

## Usage

When using this webpage, you will notice that there are different sections for each topic: HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. These sections contain the notes I took about each topic during my prework study. If you open Chrome DevTools, you will also see that JavaScript is running. Here you can see a list of topics and a suggestion for which topic to review first.
